# Sinethemba-Godlo-01 Linear Regression
Working with *Rust Rover* **(Rust programming language)** for the first time and not having a coding background or knowledge.

I struggled to understand the coding and to get assistance from the programmers (friends and colleagues) as they did not know Rust Language.

I chose **AI (ChatGPT)** to assist with Rust rover coding.

From downloading the programs to setting up dependencies that was easy, but pushing the code to *GitHub* was difficult.

I have to refer to AI (ChatGpt) for assistance this is how it assisted me with this issue:

  Step I have to run the following *commands* in the **terminal**
        *git init*
        *git remote add <github url>*
        *git add .*
        *git branch*
        *git branch -M main //to rename the branch from master to main*
        *git commit - "Initial commit"*
        *git push --force origin main*
  **Finally my code was pushed to GitHub.**
  
I requested **AI (ChatGPT)** to assist me with the code for *linear regression model* and gave the *dependencies* to use, but the code could **not run**.

Below are some of the messages **AI (ChatGPT)** provided when my *code* was not running.

I tried numerous times to change the code as instructed by **AI (ChatGPT)**, but all that failed.

Until, I request *someone* to write me a **Java code** for *linear regression model* then took that code and **converted** it to **(Rust programming language)** using **AI (ChatGPT)**
then my code ran successfully**
**Resources:**
  1. AI (ChatGPT)
  2. Programmer *(friend of mine)*

I have learned a lot in this exercise on how:
  1. Rust Code does not run without dependencies.
  2. use commands in the Terminal, like *cargo clean* to clean your data before running *cargo run/build* to see if your code is running.
  3. to force code to GitHub using *git push --force origin main*
  4. one can *push* **larger** files to GitHub using *git lfs* which is for larger files.
